Source Code Pro seems to be a bit hard to read at small o medium font sizes.
It could be my browser's font rendering, but the solution is the same - fix the

This also reverts some of the text shadow to be emboldened.

Finally the sponsors sidebar is reduced in opacity to help guide the user
towards the main web content.
